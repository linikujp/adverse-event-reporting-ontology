#summary What is an adverse event?

= Introduction =

AERO focuses on signs reported by clinicians as part of adverse event reporting forms, whether causality to the medical intervention as been established or not. 


= Details =

The current definition for the term aero:adverse event is "An adverse event is a sign presenting in a predetermined time frame following administration of a compound or usage of a device", where we rely on ogms:sign, itself defined as "A quality of a patient, a material entity that is part of a patient, or a processual entity that a patient participates in, any one of which is observed in a physical examination and is deemed by the clinician to be of clinical significance."

This differentiate the AERO ontology from the AEO ontology developed by the He group and available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/aeo/, in which adverse events are defined as being caused by the medical intervention.

A discussion pertaining to difference and usage of both resources can be found on the [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=aeo-devel&max_rows=25&style=nested&viewmonth=201102 AEO list]
