#summary The difference between AERO and AEO

= Introduction =

In AERO, the causality between the reported event and the medical intervention is not established. See the current definition of aero:adverse event at http://code.google.com/p/adverse-event-reporting-ontology/wiki/AdverseEventDefinition

This differentiates the AERO ontology from the AEO ontology developed by the He group and available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/aeo/, in which adverse events are defined as being induced by the medical intervention.

A discussion pertaining to difference and usage of both resources can be found on the [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=aeo-devel&max_rows=25&style=nested&viewmonth=201102 AEO list]

Let us consider the example of a clinician in an institution who follows some guideline and  for that reason reports that a seizure occurred in some patient who was given an immunization a few days earlier. 

AERO describes the seizure happening at the reporting time, when no association other than temporal can be established. Later on, those reported events may be used to generate an hypothesis as to whether the seizure was actually induced by the immunization - this is usually done when reports are forwarded to a committee which will assess causality relationship between the events and establish a degree of causality.

In the original driving use case case, clinicians are using specific
guidelines to describe this seizure, such as "[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14741144 Generalized convulsive seizure as an adverse event following
immunization: case definition and guidelines for data collection,
analysis, and presentation.]". In that paper, the Brighton collaboration specifies a guideline to report seizure as an adverse event following immunization (AEFI). 

AERO is a framework allowing to describe seizures as AEFI,
the guidelines they are associated with (could be Brighton, VAERS or
else), and the specifics of the seizures as described by those
guidelines (such as degrees of certainty for establishment of a
diagnostic). 

The goal is to be able to guide the clinician at the time of data
entry, by making sure that:
1/ the event they report indeed matches the case definition (such as
clinician reporting a seizure because he sees A and B - the system
would ask confirmation "did you see C as well?"),
2/ we store additional information that they may not have reported
upon otherwise (such as clinician reporting a seizure because he sees
A, B and C, but we also know that as it is a seizure there must be a D)
3/ helping to establish the correct diagnostic based on reported
symptoms (such as clinician sees A, B and C and let the system infer
that it is a seizure)

AERO may help in reconciling different reportingsystems, such as Public Health Canada and VAERS - if we describe events based on the respective guidelines being used, a reasoner would be able to infer the hierarchy of those, and we may be able to use this to relate the two datasets.
